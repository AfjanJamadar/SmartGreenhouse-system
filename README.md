# 🌿 Smart Greenhouse System

A simulation-based project that uses machine learning to predict and monitor greenhouse conditions. Instead of physical sensors, the system reads environmental data from a CSV file and runs a model to make intelligent decisions about plant health and greenhouse status.

---

## 📌 Key Features

- 🧠 Uses a trained machine learning model to process greenhouse data.
- 📊 Reads environmental data (e.g., temperature, humidity, soil moisture) from a CSV file.
- 🧪 Simulates real-time decision-making based on model predictions.
- 📝 Outputs model results that reflect potential greenhouse conditions.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- CSV File Handling
- Jupyter Notebook / Python Script

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone this repository:
  
   git clone https://github.com/AfjanJamadar/SmartGreenhouse-system.git
   cd SmartGreenhouse-system
Make sure required libraries are installed:

pip install pandas scikit-learn

Run the script:
python smart_greenhouse.py
The script will read the data.csv file and output predictions from the trained model.
